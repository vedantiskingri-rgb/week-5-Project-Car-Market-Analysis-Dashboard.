Overview
This dashboard analyzes automotive market data, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as year-to-date (YTD) sales, month-to-date (MTD) sales, year-over-year (YoY) growth, average prices, and units sold. It often uses car sales datasets including details like model, price, color, dealer region, and customer demographics to enable data-driven decisions for dealerships or manufacturers.
